##Introduction

This is the visualization module for JMR.

It is being developed using [java3d](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-jsp-138252.html)

Currently we have 2 visualization types to choose:

###Secuencial 

The image given is in the center, the ones with less weight is on its left, and the ones with more weight on its right

###Spiral:

The images follow an outward spiral pattern, the image given is in the center. As the spiral progresses images are less similar to the one given, also it reduces its size
